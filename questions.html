            <p>Dynamic typing is a feature of JavaScript that allows variables to hold values of any type without 
                any type enforcement. This means that a variable can be assigned a value of one type and then 
                later be assigned a value of a different type without any errors or warnings.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">What is a multi-paradigm language?</h1>
            <p>A multi-paradigm language is a programming language that supports more than one programming paradigm. 
                JavaScript is considered a multi-paradigm language because it supports event-driven, functional, 
                and imperative programming styles.

            <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">What is the DOM?</h1>
            <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the 
                structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to interact with and manipulate 
                the document's content, structure, and style.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">DOM vs Virtual DOM</h1>
            <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the 
                structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to interact with and manipulate 
                the document's content, structure, and style. The Virtual DOM is a concept used in frameworks like 
                React to improve performance by updating the DOM only when necessary.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">'==' vs '==='</h1>
            <p>The '==' operator in JavaScript is used for loose equality, meaning it will compare two values 
                after converting them to a common type. The '===' operator is used for strict equality, meaning 
                it will compare two values without type conversion, resulting in true only if the values are of 
                the same type and have the same value.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">What is Hoisting?</h1>
            <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top 
                of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This allows variables and functions to be 
                used before they are declared.
